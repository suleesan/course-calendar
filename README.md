# Course Calendar

Inspired to create this because I used to manually plan out quarters by drawing them on my iPad. Solutions exist (ex: Carta, onCourse) where it'll automatically plan out quarters for you, but I like the manual aspect.

Can:

- add class to calendar for a quarter
  - also update/delete classes
  - clear all classes from quarter
- switch quarters
- everything should be saved to local storage (so when you refresh, it should all still be there!)
