# Course Calendar

Inspired to create this because I used to manually plan out quarters by drawing them on my iPad. Solutions exist (ex: Carta, onCourse) where it'll automatically plan out quarters for you, but I like the manual aspect.

Can:

- add class to the calendar for each quarter
  - also update/delete classes
  - clear all classes from a quarter
- switch between quarters
- everything should be saved to local storage (so when you refresh, it should all still be there!)
- see course schedule with unit counts
- share calendar with a link! (and go back to yours with the home button)
  - see my calendar [here](https://course-calendar.vercel.app/?id=df856d13-5769-4869-af5f-807484548d91)!

Todo:

- simple web scraping to slightly reduce manual labor (might scrap this)
