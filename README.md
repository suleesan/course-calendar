# Course Calendar

Inspired to create this because I used to manually plan out quarters by drawing them on my iPad. Solutions exist (ex: Carta, onCourse) where it'll automatically plan out quarters for you, but I like the manual aspect.

Can:

- add class to calendar for a quarter
  - also update/delete classes
  - clear all classes from quarter
- switch quarters
- everything should be saved to local storage (so when you refresh, it should all still be there!)
- see course schedule
- share calendar with a link! (to get back to ur own calendar, just clear the id)
  - see my calendar [here](https://course-calendar.vercel.app/?id=5ddb9557-6598-4512-bb12-841de10018dc)!

Todo:

- add unit count / unit count totaling
- fix times displayed in schedule to not be 24-hour
- simple web scraping to slightly reduce manual labor (might scrap this)
